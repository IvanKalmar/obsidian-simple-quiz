It is possible to create custom groups that will group cards according to specified conditions<br/>
The conditions are strings in python-like syntax<br/>
<b>Currently in beta</b><br/>

Example condition:
```python 
pool in ['Current'] and score > 0.4
```
<br/>

The available variables are card fields, except for the question and with the addition of score and status
```json
{
	"id": "äºŒ", 
	"pool": "JLPT 5", 
	"tags": [
		"JLPT 5"
	], 
	"defaultSide": "left", 
	"notReversible": true, 
	"score": 0.5, 
	"status": "MIDDLE"
}
```
